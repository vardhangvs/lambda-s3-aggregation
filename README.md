# ðŸ’¼ Real-Time Salary Aggregation with AWS Lambda and S3

This project demonstrates how to build a **serverless pipeline** using AWS Lambda and S3 that automatically processes employee data files and generates salary totals by country.

Whenever a new file is uploaded to an S3 bucket, a Lambda function is triggered. It reads the file, calculates the total salary for each country, and saves the result into another S3 bucket.
